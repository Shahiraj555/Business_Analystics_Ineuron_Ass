Q1.Is it possible that an event is independent of itself? If so, when?

Ans
No, it is not possible for an event to be independent of itself.
 The concept of independence in probability theory refers to the relationship between two or more events. 
Independence means that the occurrence or non-occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the occurrence or non-occurrence of another event.
If an event is independent of itself, 
it would imply that the occurrence or non-occurrence of the event does not affect its own probability. 
However, this contradicts the very definition of probability. 
The probability of an event is determined by considering the information or conditions at hand, including the occurrence or non-occurrence of the event itself. 
Therefore, an event cannot be independent of itself.

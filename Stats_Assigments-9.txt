Q1.You are going to play 2 games of chess with an opponent whom you have never played
against before (for the sake of this problem). Your opponent is equally likely to be a
beginner, intermediate, or a master. Depending on
(a) What is your probability of winning the first game?
(b) Congratulations: you won the first game! Given this information, what is the probability
that you will also win the second game
(c) Explain the distinction between assuming that the outcomes of the games are
independent and assuming that they are conditionally independent given the opponentâ€™s
skill level. Which of these assumptions seems more reasonable, and why?

ANS
(a) Let's denote the events as follows:
W1: You win the first game.
B: Your opponent is a beginner.
I: Your opponent is intermediate.
M: Your opponent is a master.

We are given the following probabilities:
P(B) = P(I) = P(M) = 1/3 (equally likely to be a beginner, intermediate, or master)

We want to find the probability of winning the first game, denoted as P(W1).

Using the law of total probability, we can calculate P(W1) by considering all possible scenarios:

P(W1) = P(W1|B) * P(B) + P(W1|I) * P(I) + P(W1|M) * P(M)

Since we don't have any information about the skill levels, we assume that the probabilities of winning are independent of the opponent's skill level. In other words, the probability of winning the first game is the same regardless of whether the opponent is a beginner, intermediate, or a master.

Let's denote the probability of winning the first game against a beginner as P(W1|B), against an intermediate as P(W1|I), and against a master as P(W1|M).

P(W1) = P(W1|B) * 1/3 + P(W1|I) * 1/3 + P(W1|M) * 1/3

(b) Given that you won the first game, we want to find the probability of winning the second game, denoted as P(W2|W1).

Since the opponent's skill level doesn't change between games, we assume that the outcomes of the games are independent of each other given the opponent's skill level. In other words, winning the first game doesn't affect the probability of winning the second game.

Therefore, the probability of winning the second game, given that you won the first game, is the same as the probability of winning any game against the opponent.

P(W2|W1) = P(W2)

(c) Assuming that the outcomes of the games are independent means that the probability of winning each game is the same regardless of the opponent's skill level. This assumption implies that your skill and performance are consistent and not affected by the skill level of your opponent. It assumes that your ability to win the second game is not influenced by the outcome of the first game.

On the other hand, assuming that the outcomes of the games are conditionally independent given the opponent's skill level means that the probability of winning each game can vary based on the opponent's skill level. This assumption suggests that your performance may be influenced by the skill level of your opponent. Winning the first game against a beginner may give you confidence and affect your performance positively in the second game, while winning against a master may make you more cautious or motivated to perform better in the second game.

In this scenario, assuming that the outcomes are conditionally independent given the opponent's skill level seems more reasonable. The skill level of the opponent can have an impact on the game, and your performance may vary based on the skill level you are facing. Winning or losing the first game can affect your mindset and approach in the second game, depending on the opponent's skill level.

Q1.For a group of 7 people, find the probability that all 4 seasons (winter, spring, summer, fall)
occur at least once each among their birthdays, assuming that all seasons are equally likely.


Ans
Let's denote D(i) as the number of derangements where season i occupies its corresponding position. There are four seasons, so we can calculate the number of derangements using the inclusion-exclusion principle as follows:

D(1) = 0 (since season 1 cannot be in its position)
D(2) = 6! (number of derangements of the remaining six positions)
D(3) = 5! (number of derangements of the remaining five positions)
D(4) = 5! (number of derangements of the remaining five positions)

Now, using the inclusion-exclusion principle, we can calculate the number of derangements where none of the seasons occupy their corresponding position:

Number of derangements = 7! - D(1) - D(2) - D(3) - D(4) = 7! - 6! - 5! - 5! - 5!

Finally, we can calculate the probability by dividing the number of derangements by the total number of possible arrangements:

Probability = Number of derangements / 7!
The probability that all four seasons occur at least once among the birthdays of the seven people is approximately 0.01587301587, or approximately 1.59%.

Q1Give an example of 3 events A, B, C which are pairwise independent but not independent.
Hint: find an example where whether C occurs is completely determined if we know whether
A occurred and whether B occurred, but completely undetermined if we know only one of
these things.

Ans
To find the probability that the new email is spam given that it mentions "free money," we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:

A: The email is spam.
B: The email mentions "free money."

We are given the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.80 (probability of an email being spam)
P(B|A) = 0.10 (probability of "free money" being mentioned in spam email)
P(B|¬A) = 0.01 (probability of "free money" being mentioned in non-spam email)

We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the email is spam given that it mentions "free money."

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

P(¬A) represents the probability of an email not being spam, which is equal to 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20.

Now, we can substitute the given values into the formulas:

P(B) = (0.10 * 0.80) + (0.01 * 0.20) = 0.08 + 0.002 = 0.082

P(A|B) = (0.10 * 0.80) / 0.082 ≈ 0.975

Therefore, the probability that the new email is spam, given that it mentions "free money," is approximately 0.975 or 97.5%.
